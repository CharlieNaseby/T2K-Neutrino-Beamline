# T2K-Neutrino-Beamline
This is a respository intended to house all code necessary to simulate the T2K neutrino beamline (preparation section) in the accelerator tracking software BDSIM (L.J. Nevay et al., BDSIM: An Accelerator Tracking Code with Particle-Matter Interactions, Computer Physics Communications 252 107200 (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107200). This intends to include simulation of beam loss and comparison to existing beam loss measurements at the beamline with the goal to determine improvements in optics or collimator design to reduce beam loss particularly in the preparation section of the neutrino beamline.
